. Write a Java program to display your name, age, and college name using variables of appropriate 
data types. 
2. Input two integers and print the result of all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, and modulus). 
3. Write a program to demonstrate the use of relational operators by comparing two numbers. 
4. Accept a floating-point number and convert it explicitly to an integer. Print both the original and 
the converted values. 
5. Write a program to accept a character and print its ASCII value. 
6. Accept a number and check if it is even or odd using the % operator and if-else. 
7. Input a number and check if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 using logical operators. 
8. Input a character and check whether it is a vowel or a consonant using if-else. 
9. Input marks of three subjects, calculate total and percentage, and print pass/fail using if-else 
(passing criteria: >=40% in all subjects). 
10. Write a program to find the greatest of two numbers using if-else. 
Intermediate Level (11–15) 
11. Write a program to input three numbers and print the largest using nested if-else. 
12. Accept a year and check whether it is a leap year using if-else. 
13. Accept a number and check whether it is positive, negative, or zero using if-else. 
14. Accept a character and check if it is a digit, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or a special 
character using character classification and if-else. 
15. Accept a 3-digit number and check whether it is an Armstrong number or not using arithmetic 
operators and if-else. 
Advanced Level (16–20) 
16. Input salary and calculate tax based on income slabs using if-else: 
● Income ≤ 250000: No tax 
● 250001 to 500000: 5% 
● 500001 to 1000000: 20% 
● Above 1000000: 30% 
17. Create a Java program to accept an integer and check whether it is a palindrome using type 
casting and expressions. 
18. Write a Java program that accepts a number and prints whether it is prime or not using if-else. 
19. Accept a character and use if-else to identify whether it's a valid operator (+, -, *, /) and perform 
the corresponding operation on two input numbers. 
20. Accept age and gender and determine eligibility for marriage (e.g., male ≥ 21, female ≥ 18) using 
nested if-else conditions. 
Question Set (21–30) 
21. Accept three angles from the user and check whether they can form a valid triangle (sum of 
angles = 180°). 
22. Input the length and breadth of a rectangle, and determine whether it is a square or not using 
if-else. 
23. Input a temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using type casting and expressions. 
24. Accept a number and check whether it is a perfect number or not (sum of divisors = number) 
using basic arithmetic and if-else. 
25. Accept two integers and a logical operator as a character. Use if-else to perform the logical 
operation and display the result. 
26. Write a Java program to input a five-digit number and check whether the first and last digits are 
the same using arithmetic expressions and type casting. 
27. Input the cost price and selling price of an item. Determine whether there is a profit or loss, and 
by how much, using if-else. 
28. Accept a number and display the number of digits using expressions and if-else. 
29. Input the height (in cm) of a person and classify them as short, average, or tall: 
● < 150: Short 
● 150–170: Average 
● 170: Tall 
30. Write a Java program to simulate a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and performs the corresponding operation using if-else.
